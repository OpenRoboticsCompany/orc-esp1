This board provides power, GPIO, and Micro SD to the commonly-available
ESP8266 wifi modules. This first revision is intended for internal use
at Open Robotics Company, but may find it's way out to the world also.

Built using [KiCad EDA](http://kicad.org/)

Important Build Notes
---------------------

Please note that we used a nightly dev build of KiCad for this project.
You cannot open the files in the current stable version (4.0.5 as of this
writing).  We used *kicad-r7402.f631ae2-x86_64* on Windows. It's possible
that later versions will open the files, but because nightly builds are
always changing, you never know!
